    "### Introduction:\n",
    "PLAICraft is a project run by the PLAI (Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence) group at UBC’s Computer Science Department. Through this project, participants are able to play *Minecraft* for free on their browser on a shared server world where data such as audio, key presses, mouse inputs, and video footage is collected from players to train an Artificial Intelligence model. \n",
    "Our group first chose a broad question that we wanted to answer using datasets from this project. We ended up choosing: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which ‘kinds’ of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data?** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this broad question, we had to narrow it down and make it more specific. We decided that we can use ‘total played hours’ as a metric for the amount of data contributed and that age would be an interesting variable to correlate it with. Therefore, this report will focus on answering the following specific question: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can age predict the total played hours for participants?** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we were provided with two datasets: ‘players.csv’ and ‘sessions.csv’. <br>\n",
    "The players.csv dataset includes data on the PLAICraft players themselves, totalling 196 observations and 7 variables including: <br>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        experience: The player’s prior experience with *Minecraft*\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        subscribe: Whether the player is subscribed to the PLAICraft mailing list\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        hashedEmail: The player’s encrypted email\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        played_hours: The player’s total hours on the PLAICraft server\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        name: The player’s first name\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        gender: The player’s gender\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        Age: The player’s age\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The second dataset, sessions.csv, includes data on PLAICraft sessions. It totals 1,535 observations, each representing an individual player’s play session on the server. The dataset includes 5 variables:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        hashedEmail: The player’s encrypted email\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        start_time: The play session’s start time including date, month, year, and time in 24-hour clock format\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        end_time: The play session’s end time including date, month, year, and time in 24-hour clock format\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        original_start_time: The play session’s start time in a different format.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>\n",
    "        original_end_time: The play session’s end time in a different format.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "Our methods will focus on using the <b>players.csv</b> dataset to answer our question."
